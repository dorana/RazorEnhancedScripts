# RazorEnhancedScripts

This is my bundle of script for Razor Enhanced, Some are useful, some not so much, as they are designed for a very specific purpose upon request from someone.

Below you can see some hghlights of the larger scripts I have made.

Some have a more detailed Wiki page for further documentation.

If you have feature requests to any of my scripts or you find a bug, please report them as issues, adding an appropriate Label would be helpful

## LootMaster

This is an autolooter that uses a set of rules, each rule has it's own settings, and each characters has his or hers own ruleset
More info on how this works can be found here
https://gamebible.net/wiki/doku.php?id=lootmaster

## SlayerBar

This is a hotbar script. it will look though your skills to find your primary damage skill,
then check your enventory for a bag that contains slayers on weapons that matches that skill.

It will then generate a bar with buttons, clicking hese buttons will swap to the corresponding slayer,  and return your current weapon to the previously designated slayer bag.

It's highly recomended to put all your players in a designated bag, rather than having them loose in your backpack, The backpack works,
but if you might have multiple slayers of the same type and thus the script would list both.

## RuneMaster

RuneMaster is a 1-click travel script.
At first launch it will scan your backpack for rune books and atlases, including those in your strap and build a database of the rnes you have.
These can be grouped by book or map, or displayed as a single list.
They can be displayed alphabetically or by the location in their respective books.
It supports Recall, Gate Travel, and Sacred Journey. depending on your skill levels.

newly added runes can be synced by using the "Update Runes" button in the options panel.
Runes will display in color (optional) depending on the map they are on.

It also supports a search function for those with a large amount of runes stored for simplified use.


## MiningMaster

This is a mining automation script.
It allows the player to record a path and store the locations where the user mines.
You may then save this path and mark a rune for it with the same name(this can be done automatically).
These paths can later be replayed automatically.

The script will handle smelting, and supports the use of mining satchelm it can also be toggled to use Bag of sending to send the largest ingot pile to your bank.
This happens when you go over your carry capcity after the smelting process.

The script does not handle ambushes or approaching players, while the script can run unattended it's not recommended, and may violate server rules,

**please always follow the rules of the server you are playing on.**

## ShadowGuard

A semi automated helper script for Shadowguard.
This script will automatically detect the current room you are in and load the corresponding helper.
This script will automate...
- Automatically pickup and throw bottle in the bar
- Automatically detect the Tree and Apple matches in Orchard
- Automatically pick up, purify and throw phillacteries in the Armory
- Automatically detect, calculate, pick up and place canal pieces in the Fountain
- Automaticaly pickup wings in the Belfry, a button will show in the gump that allows you to use the wing to fly up to the dragon

Each room has a gump extension attached to it that will activly display room data, such as currently held bottles or phillacteries, or the current canal pieces remaining

This script is extremely powerful for those who want to run Shadowguard.
This script is aimed at people who has done several runs of Shadowguard and know the mechanics of the rooms and has experienced this awesome dungeon.

**Do not use this script if...**
- You have never done Shadowguard before
- If your server has a rule against automation

This script also is a great tool for people with any type of disability that prevents them from playing the game normally,
such as a motor disability or visual impairment since it removes the tedious tasks of clicking items in fast succession.
